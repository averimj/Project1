// Created an array of quote objects

// Created a random number generator that pulls from the quotes array

	document.getElementById('quote-box').innerHTML = quoteWithProperties;

	randomBackgroundColor();

// Created a timer to change quotes every 7 seconds

 let timer = setInterval(printQuote, 7000);


// Created a random background generator work ... source: https://www.w3resource.com â€º javascript-math-exercise-40

   const randomBackgroundColor = () => {

	let color = `rgb(${red}, ${green},  ${blue})`;

   	document.body.style.backgroundColor = color;
   };


// added an event listener to change quotes when the "Show another quote" button is clicked

document.getElementById('loadQuote').addEventListener("click", printQuote, false);
